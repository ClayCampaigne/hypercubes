[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ClayCampaigne/hypercubes/HEAD?urlpath=tree/tree/ipynb)

Manipulating n-dimensional solids (wireframes for now) with ipywidgets and bqplot.

Click the "launch binder" link, wait for the remote virtual machine to be built, then click ndcubes.ipynb to open 
(The online/binder version only works on a computer web browser. I still can't figure out why I can't directly link to the notebook).

Run all the cells by going to Kernel menu -> Restart and Run All.

You can find ndims in cell #7 to change the dimensionality of the cube for now.

The i'th slider rotates the first dimension into the i+1th dimemension.
