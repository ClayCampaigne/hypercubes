[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ClayCampaigne/hypercubes/HEAD?filepath=ndcubes.ipynb)

Interactive n-dimensional hypercube visualization using ipywidgets and bqplot.

Click the "launch binder" link above to open the notebook directly in your browser. Wait for the environment to build, then run the cells to start exploring hypercubes!

## Features

- **Dynamic dimension selection**: Use the dimension slider to switch between 2D to 8D hypercubes in real-time
- **Interactive rotation controls**: Each slider rotates dimension 0 into dimension i+1
- **Clean modular architecture**: All core functionality organized in proper Python modules
- **Multiple examples**: From simple 4D cubes to complex 6D+ visualizations

## Usage

1. Run all cells with "Kernel â†’ Restart and Run All"
2. Use the dimension slider to select 2-8 dimensions
3. Manipulate the rotation sliders to explore the hypercube from different angles
4. Try the different examples to see various configurations

The visualization works best on desktop browsers with adequate screen space for the interactive widgets.
